### There are 4 parts/ questions: 

### question 1: Memory Layout of C Programs

using linux tools like objdump, nm and size to determine where the variables are located in memory


### question 2: Signals

part 1: check if process with some PID exists, using kill(pid, 0) command, and errno variable

part 2: implementing a client and server programs. 
        client sends two types of signals: SIGINT, SIGUSR1
        server gets the signals, counts them and prints
        
      
### question 3: CPU scheduling

set the priority and the policy of a running process


### question 4: file system in Linux

Scan an entire library recursively, and perform operations on the files.
check it's inode number and it's type. ignore soft links.


## ! each question contains a makefile to compile, and a README that explains how to run !
